/*TODO
 * 1. Avoid converting the password to a String — Keep it as a char[] to improve security.
 * 2. Clear the password array after use to avoid it lingering in memory.
 * 3. Add password validation (e.g., length, complexity).
 * 4. Use the master key for something meaningful, like encryption or authentication.
 * 5. Implement functionality to store or verify the master key safely.
 * 6. Handle exceptions and edge cases gracefully.
