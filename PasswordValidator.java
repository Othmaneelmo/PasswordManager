/*TODO:
this should probably be reworked, since were working on the MASTER KEY complexity checker. not random password.
BUT, i would leave this for now since it should not stop or slow making the other essential features for the password manager.
here are things that should be implemented:
-  minimum 16 chars, 24+ if using passphrases (white space, no symbols), (passphrases are encouraged, 7+ words i suppose)
-  Character diversity (if not a passphrase)
        - At least one uppercase letter (A–Z)
        - At least one lowercase letter (a–z)
        - At least one digit (0–9)
        - At least one special character from a broad set (not just !@#$%)
        - No restriction on repeated characters — repetition isn’t inherently weak if length is good.
-  Blacklist weak patterns
        - Disallow passwords in common breach lists (check against a Have I Been Pwned database). (API MAYBE??)
        - Disallow obvious sequences like 123456, abcdef, keyboard walks (qwertyui), or simple substitutions (P@ssw0rd).

-  Unicode & space support
        - Support spaces so users can make easy-to-remember passphrases.
        - Allow Unicode characters (but watch for normalization issues — store them in a canonical form like NFC).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOLLOWING are CHATGPT recommmendation (check for validity later):
-  Rate-limiting and offline resistance
        - Even with strong rules, implement slow hashing (e.g., Argon2id with high memory cost) so brute force attempts are impractical.
        - Rate-limit and lockout for online entry attempts.

-  No arbitrary “max length” unless necessary
        - Many breaches happen because developers truncate or mishandle long passwords.
        - Support at least 128 characters to future-proof.

-  Educate instead of frustrate
        - Don’t just reject a password — explain why it’s weak and show examples of better ones.
        - If you support passphrases, make that clear in the UI (“A long phrase like ‘correct horse battery staple lamp’ is stronger than P@ssw0rd1!”).

-  Avoid forced regular changes
        - For a master key, forcing users to change it every X days leads to weaker, easier-to-remember passwords.
        - Instead, require change only if it’s compromised.

-  Encourage a secure backup method
        - Users might forget a 24-character passphrase.
        - Provide a secure recovery key or offline backup method (encrypted & stored safely) instead of weaker recovery questions.

-  No predictable truncation or hashing quirks
        - If your backend only stores the first N bytes for some reason, an attacker could exploit that.
        - Always hash the entire master key with something like Argon2id and never truncate before hashing.

-  Entropy measurement, not just pattern rules
        - Two passwords can meet all “has uppercase, lowercase, number, special” rules and still be weak (P@ssw0rd123!).
        - Use an entropy estimator (like zxcvbn) to reject anything with estimated crack time < ~10^14 guesses.

-  Handle copy-paste correctly
        - Don’t disable paste into the password field — it allows password managers to fill long keys.
        - Just protect against clipboard leaks.

-  Make typos harder to cause lockout
        - Consider allowing a small number of retry attempts before exponential lockout.
        - Warn if Caps Lock is on or if there are leading/trailing spaces.

-  Secure transport from client to server
        - Even the strongest master key is useless if it’s sent in plaintext or logged.
        - Use TLS, avoid logging input, and sanitize all storage paths.

/*
TL;DR: 
 *Validates passwords without creating Strings (works on char[] directly).
 * 
 * Checks performed:
 *  - Minimum length: 12 characters
 *  - Must include at least 3 of: lowercase, uppercase, digit, symbol
 *  - Cannot start or end with whitespace
 *  - Cannot contain whitespace or control characters
 *  - Must have ≥ 5 unique characters
 *  - Cannot contain simple ascending sequences (≥ 4 chars, case-insensitive)
 *  - Rejects exact matches from a small built-in blacklist
 * 
 * Returns ValidationResult with pass/fail status and reasons list.
 * 
 * Design notes:
 *  - Incremental design: future commits add more checks without changing existing code
 *  - No String allocation → minimizes GC overhead & improves security (avoids lingering copies)
